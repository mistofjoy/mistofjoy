👋 Hi! I'm Jhonkar Sufia (AKA @mistofjoy)

I'm a mechanical engineer that just started to dive into technology in 2021. I'm currently learning Data Science at platzi.com, and I've been working at Cargill for 3 years as warehouse supervisor for a food processing plant.

I'm passionate about business intelligence and business development. I love to dig into data and find opportunities to improve performance and profitability.

My current personal project is a fiction book that's still in the oven. I'll let you know more soon enough... oh! and I also feel curious about the math behind role-playing videogames.

As of now, if you want, you can reach me on jhonkarsufia1995@gmail.com

Have a nice day! n.n
