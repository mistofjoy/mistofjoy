ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jhonkar Sufia (AKA @mistofjoy)

I'm a mechanical engineer that just started to dive into IT in 2021. I'm currently learning Web Development at platzi.com, and I've been working at Cargill for 3 years as warehouse supervisor for a food processing plant.

I'm a rookie writer. I'm working on the third draft of a 90k words novel. I wanted to eventually build a platform to communicate my thoughts and promote my work, and that goal eventually led me to web development :)

As of 2021, I am still a developer in training. But I still have three years worth of corporate experience, leading a team of up to four collaborators, and managing a monthly 40kUSD budget. I'm good at self-learning, and I'm confident in my communication and collaboration skills.

I may still be in training. But once I learn the ropes, I might surprise you ;) 

you can reach me on jhonkarsufia1995@gmail.com

Have a nice day! n.n
